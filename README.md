# JamAmp
The purpose of this project is to create a .NET CORE website in it's entirety using all of the skills taught throughout the courses at CPTC in Lakewood, WA. 
We were asked to come up with an idea and do our best to make that vision happen. I have chosen JamAmp, which is, in a nutshell, a guitarists Karaoke-ish Jam site.
I will use a JavaScript Library to employ an Interface that is a plug and play guitar amp with adjustable settings. I will create a database of JamTracks and have them available to the user through drop down categories like, rock, country, and blues. The idea is anywhere you are, with an internet connection, a portable interface and an instrument you will be able to Jam along to a multitude of available backing tracks. I hope to have features such as favorite tracks and possibly the ability to upload Jams for other users to hear and Jam along with. A complete list of features will be listed here as they become available, so stay TUNED, lol
(see what I did there, tuned?)....Let's have some fun and see what we can build!
